# NGS Data Processing with R

## Introduction

This repository contains an R script for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data in FASTQ format. The script performs various tasks such as quality filtering, sequence trimming, quality analysis, translation of DNA sequences into amino acids, and exporting the results.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ngs-data-processing.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have R installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

3. Install the required R packages by running the following commands in your R console:
   ```R
   install.packages("BiocManager")
   BiocManager::install(c("ShortRead", "Rqc", "Biostrings", "FastqCleaner", "BiocParallel", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyverse"))
   ```

4. Set the working directory in the R script to the location where your FASTQ file is located:
   ```R
   setwd("path/to/your/data")
   ```

5. Execute the R script `ngs_processing_script.R` in your R environment.

6. The script will perform various processing steps on your FASTQ file and output diagnostic plots and processed data.

## Requirements

- R (https://www.r-project.org/)
- Bioconductor packages: ShortRead, Rqc, Biostrings, FastqCleaner, BiocParallel
- Other R packages: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse
